 * The airport database is the primary repository of knowledge about airports,
 * runways and bounding boxes.
 *
 * To start using the airport database, first initialize an \ref airportdb_t
 * using airportdb_create(). This doesn't actually populate the database.
 * You will then want to call adb_recreate_cache() on the initialized database,
 * to actually make sure it is up to date. Subsequently, you can start using
 * the various airport lookup and query functions to interrogate the database.
 * When done, use airportdb_destroy() to free the database and its resources.
 * @see airportdb_create()
 * @see adb_recreate_cache()
 * @see airportdb_destroy()
 * @see adb_airport_lookup_global()
 * @see adb_airport_index_walk()
 *
 * Implementation Details
 * ----------------------
 *
 * The airport database is composed of two data structures:
 *
 * - a global ident -> airport_t AVL tree (apt_dat). This allows us to
 *	quickly locate an airport based on its identifier.
 * - a geo-referenced AVL tree from approximate airport reference point
 *	position (in 1-degree accuracy) to the airport_t (geo_table). This
 *	allows us to quickly sift through the airport database to locate any
 *	airports close to a given point of interest.
 *
 * Of these, apt_dat is the primary repository of knowledge - once an airport
 * is gone from apt_dat, it is freed. An airport may or may not be
 * geo-referenced in the geo_table. Once all loading of an airport is
 * complete, it WILL be geo-referenced.
 *
 * The geo_table is actually comprised of tile_t data structures. A tile_t
 * refers to a 1x1 degree geographical tile at specific coordinates and
 * contains its own private airport_t tree, which is again organized by
 * abstract identifier, allowing us to step through all the airports in a
 * tile or quickly locate one based on identifier.
 *
 * During normal operation, not all airports from all over the world are
 * loaded into memory, as that would use quite a bit of memory and delay
 * startup. Instead, only the closets 9 tiles around the aircraft are
 * present. New tiles are loaded as the aircraft repositions and the old
 * ones are released. Loading a tile first populates the global apt_dat
 * with all its airports, which are then geo-referenced in the newly
 * created tile. Releasing a tile is the converse, ultimately ending in
 * the airports being purged from apt_dat and freed.
 *
 * The 9-tile rule can result in strange behavior close to the poles, where
 * the code might think of close by airports as being very far away and
 * thus not load them. Luckily, there are only about 4 airports beyond 80
 * degrees latitude (north or south), all of which are very special
 * non-regular airports, so we just ignore those.
 *
 * Airport Data Construction Method
 * --------------------------------
 *
 * For each airport, we need to obtain the following pieces of information:
 *
 * 1. The abstract airport identifier.
 *	- Optional ICAO identifier, on a 1302 icao_code line.
 *	- Optional IATA identifier, on a 1302 iata_code line.
 * 2. The airport reference point latitude, longitude and elevation.
 * 3. The airport's transition altitude and transition level (if published).
 * 4. For each runway:
 *	- Runway width.
 *	- Each threshold's geographical position and elevation.
 *	- If the threshold is displaced, the amount of displacement.
 *	- For each end, if available, the optimal glidepath angle and
 *	   threshold clearing height.
 *
 * First we examine all installed scenery. That means going through each
 * apt.dat declared in scenery_packs.ini and the global default apt dat
 * to find these kinds of records:
 *
 * - '1' records identify airports. See parse_apt_dat_1_line.
 * - '21' records identify runway-related lighting fixtures (PAPIs/VASIs).
 *	See parse_apt_dat_21_line.
 * - '50' through '56' and '1050' through '1056' records identify frequency
 *	information. See parse_apt_dat_freq_line.
 * - '100' records identify runways. See parse_apt_dat_100_line.
 * - '1302' records identify airport meta-information, such as ICAO code,
 *	TA, TL, reference point location, etc.
 *
 * Prior to X-Plane 11, apt.dat's didn't necessarily contain the '1302'
 * records, so we had to pull those from the Airports.txt in the navdata
 * directory for the built-in GNS430. Starting from X-Plane 11, Airports.txt
 * is gone and this data has been relocated to the apt.dat.
 *
 * A further complication of the absence of an Airports.txt is that this
 * file contained both the GPA and TCH for each runway and although it did
 * sometimes require some fuzzy matching to account for outdated scenery
 * not exactly matching the navdata, we could obtain this information from
 * one place.
 *
 * So for X-Plane 11, we've implemented a new method of obtaining this
 * information. By default, if a runway has an instrument approach (unless
 * ifr_only=B_FALSE), it will have an entry in CIFP. Runway entries in
 * APPCH-type procedures specify the TCH and GPA in columns 24 and 29 (ARINC
 * 424 fields 4.1.9.1.85-89 and 4.1.9.1.103-106). We only use the first
 * such occurence. If there are multiple approaches to the runway, they
 * should all end up with the same TCH and GPA. This should cover pretty much
 * every case. In the rare case where we *don't* get the TCH and GPA this way,
 * we try a fallback mechanism. Almost every instrument approach runway has
 * some kind of visual glideslope indication (VGSI) right next to it. We can
 * extract the location of those from the apt.dat file. These VGSIs are
 * located in the exact touchdown point and have a fixed GPA. So we simply
 * look for a VGSI close to the runway's centerline and that is aligned with
 * the runway, compute the longitudinal displacement of this indicator from
 * the runway threshold and using the indicator's GPA compute the optimal TCH.
