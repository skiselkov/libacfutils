/**
 * \file
 *
 * This file contains a portable method for creating, destroying and managing
 * OpenGL contexts in X-Plane. While X-Plane will provide you an OpenGL
 * context on the main thread, it is sometimes useful to create other
 * contexts for background threads for asynchronous work.
 *
 * @see glctx_create_invisible()
 * @see glctx_make_current()
 * @see glctx_destroy()
 *
 * OpenGL Versions
 * ---------------
 *
 * OpenGL comes in two major flavors:
 *
 * - Modern OpenGL (3.2+)
 * - Legacy OpenGL (2.0 and earlier)
 *
 * There are major incompatibilities between the two branches and
 * you SHOULD always strive to write modern OpenGL code, not legacy.
 * On Windows and Linux, you can request a modern OpenGL context
 * (version 4.0 or later) and most reasonably recent drivers will
 * transparently support legacy OpenGL constructs (unless you set
 * fwd_compat=B_TRUE, in which case we will instruct the driver to
 * explicitly reject legacy features).
 *
 * However, on MacOS this separation is enforced with an iron hand.
 * So on MacOS, glctx_create_invisible() ignores the version arguments
 * except for `major_ver`:
 *
 * - if you specify major_ver <= 2, you will get OpenGL legacy
 *	(version 1.0 up to 2.1 core features)
 * - if you specify major_ver = 3, you will get OpenGL 3.2+ feature
 *	compatibility
 * - in all other cases, you will get up to OpenGL 4.1 feature
 *	compatibility.
 *
 * Please note that MacOS doesn't support any later OpenGL revisions,
 * so the maximum you can get reliably is the OpenGL 4.1 core profile.

/**
 * Creates an invisible OpenGL context of a specified version in a
 * platform-independent way. Please note that this must be called on
 * the main X-Plane thread. To create a background rendering thread,
 * call glctx_create_invisible() on the main thread, then hand off the
 * created glctx_t to the background thread, which will subsequently
 * set it as its current context using glctx_make_current().
 *
 * @param win_ptr An opaque window pointer to a backing window that the
 *	OpenGL will be based on. The context will NOT be drawing to this
 *	window. The window handle is only used to fetch hardware context
 *	information such as the target GPU and supported capabilities.
 *	Unless you know exactly what you are doing, you should always
 *	pass the return value of glctx_get_xplane_win_ptr() here.
 * @param share_ctx An optional OpenGL context that you want the new
 *	context to share resources with. Please note that this will also
 *	share the command pipeline between the contexts, which can
 *	introduced undesirable command contention, so use with care.
 * @param major_ver Major OpenGL version requested. See "OpenGL Versions".
 * @param minor_ver Major OpenGL version requested. See "OpenGL Versions".
 * @param fwd_compat If set to true, the returned OpenGL context will NOT
 *	be backwards compatible. See "OpenGL Versions" for more info.
 * @param debug Enables additional error checking and reporting on
 *	platforms that support it (Linux & Windows), often at the cost of
 *	some performance. Enable on debug code, disable on production code.
 *
 * @return On success, an initialized OpenGL context. On failure, the
 *	function returns `NULL` and prints an error reason to the log.
 *	The returned context will NOT yet have been made the current
 *	context. To make the context current, use glctx_make_current.
